# Installation

## Requirements

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or higher is recommended. However other major Linux distribution are supported but may lead to installation issues. Please file an issue if you encounter one.

## Download and install Tipi

Download the latest version of Tipi:

```bash
curl -L https://setup.runtipi.com | bash
```

The script will prompt you the ip address of the dashboard once configured.

## Commands

If you already installed Tipi, you can start it manually by running the `start.sh` script in the `runtipi` folder.

```bash
cd runtipi
sudo ./scripts/start.sh
```

Tipi will run by default on port 80. To select another port you can run the start script with the `--port` argument

```bash
sudo ./scripts/start.sh --port 7000
```

To stop Tipi, run the stop script.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/stop.sh
```

## Update Tipi

To update Tipi to the latest version, run the update script.

```bash
sudo ./scripts/system.sh update
```
